For Minecraft server administrators, x-ray cheats are a persistent threat, exposing valuable resources and undermining the game's balance. This guide breaks down the two main approaches to combatting Minecraft x-ray hacks: preventative systems that obscure valuable blocks versus detection-based plugins that identify suspicious player behavior. We'll help you decide which method best fits your server's needs by looking at performance impact, effectiveness, and ease of setup.

## Prevention-Based Solutions: Making Ores Invisible to Cheaters

These anti-cheat systems focus on prevention by altering what players can see. This makes x-ray clients useless from the start, rather than just detecting them after the fact.

### PaperMC's Anti-Xray: Built-In Protection

PaperMC’s built-in anti-xray tool has three engine modes that disguise valuable blocks to stop cheaters:

- **Engine-mode 1**: A less resource-intensive option that conceals ores completely surrounded by solid blocks.
- **Engine-mode 2**: A more comprehensive mode that uses fake blocks to hide ores adjacent to open air.
- **Engine-mode 3**: Optimizes chunk packet compression to cut down on network usage, especially when players are loading new chunks.

**Key limitation**: This tool can't hide ores next to air or transparent blocks (like in caves) unless you specifically add blocks like "air" to the list of placeholders.

**Configuration tip**: For the best results, use engine-mode 2 and add "air" to your list of fake blocks. This helps conceal resources visible from caves and other open areas. Remember that you must restart your server for these changes to take effect; a simple `/reload` won't work on already-loaded worlds.

### Orebfuscator: Packet-Level Obfuscation

Orebfuscator works by changing the network packets sent to players, hiding specific blocks without actually modifying the world itself. This way, players who aren't cheating see everything normally, while those using x-ray find only false information.

## Detection-Based Solutions: Spotting Suspicious Behavior

Instead of hiding resources, detection systems watch what players do, flagging potential cheating based on unusual behavior and packet data.

### Vulcan Anti-Cheat: A Comprehensive Detector

Vulcan detects cheats at the packet level and works on Minecraft versions from 1.7 to 1.18.2. You can set it up to either silently flag suspicious activity or to actively block cheating in real-time. This gives admins the choice to gather evidence before issuing a ban or to stop cheaters in their tracks.

### MineGuard: A Lightweight and Modular Option

MineGuard is a lightweight, modular anti-cheat system for Minecraft 1.17.1 to 1.21.7. It's designed to catch cheaters with high precision, so it won't interfere with the gameplay of honest players.

## Performance Impact Analysis

**Prevention systems** (like PaperMC's tool and Orebfuscator):
- Can be more demanding on the CPU at first due to block modification.
- Often reduce network traffic (especially Paper's engine-mode 3).
- Won't accidentally punish innocent players with false positives.
- Provide immediate protection right out of the box.

**Detection systems** (like Vulcan and MineGuard):
- Use fewer server resources by default.
- Require continuous monitoring, which adds some overhead.
- Can sometimes flag innocent players, requiring an admin to step in.
- Become more effective over time as they learn player patterns.

## Choosing the Right Minecraft X-Ray Hack Solution

For the best protection, think about using a hybrid approach that combines both prevention and detection. Using a mix of packet-level cheat detection and block-hiding techniques gives you the best of both worlds: immediate defense and long-term monitoring.

**Recommended configuration**:
- **Primary**: Use PaperMC's anti-xray (engine-mode 2) for instant ore protection.
- **Secondary**: Add a lightweight detection plugin to monitor player behavior.
- **Backup**: Keep an eye on mining patterns and player stats yourself.

Ultimately, a lightweight and modular anti-cheat plugin is often the best choice. These tools strike a great balance, catching cheaters effectively without negatively impacting the experience for everyone else.
