As a server admin, you know the headache: players using Minecraft xray hack tools can ruin fair play and wreck your server's economy. These cheats make common blocks like stone invisible, giving users a direct line to valuable resources with an unfair advantage. This guide will walk you through a proven strategy for catching xray users quickly, combining automated tools with smart, manual observation.

## Understanding How Minecraft X Ray Hacks Work

X-ray hacks work by turning standard blocks like stone and dirt transparent, revealing only valuable ores through the terrain. This creates tell-tale behaviors that you, as an admin, can learn to spot.

Unlike cheats with more obvious visual cues, x-ray modifications are invisible to other players. A user might look like they're mining normally, but they're secretly bee-lining for diamonds, ancient debris, and other treasures with uncanny precision.

## A Fast, Three-Layered Defense System

Your best bet is to layer your defenses. Combine automated server-side tools with active monitoring and a bit of manual investigation.

### Layer 1: PaperMC's Built-in Anti-Xray

If you're running PaperMC, you already have a powerful tool at your disposal. Its built-in Anti-Xray system has three engine modes to hide or fake ore placements for clients. Enable PaperMC's anti-xray feature on `engine-mode 2` for stronger obfuscation against exposed ores.

This feature works on the server side to stop xray clients from getting real ore data, effectively neutralizing the hack without any extra plugins.

### Layer 2: Automated Monitoring with XrayDetector

The XrayDetector plugin acts as your automated watchdog. It uses a four-tier suspicion system to track how efficiently players are mining and alerts your staff to suspicious activity. The plugin tracks digging habits and automatically flags players finding ores at a rate that just isn't normal.

If you get an alert, use `/xray tp <player>` to spectate the suspect invisibly and confirm if they're cheating. This command lets you observe them in real-time without tipping them off.

### Layer 3: Historical Verification with CoreProtect

CoreProtect is your logbook. It records all block changes, which is perfect for checking if a suspicious, empty tunnel used to be full of ore. This tool provides concrete evidence of strange digging behavior by showing you exactly which blocks were broken and when.

## Manual Detection Techniques

Even with the best tools, nothing beats a trained eye. Here are the red flags to watch for:

**Telltale Signs of X-Raying:**
- Perfectly straight tunnels that lead directly to ore veins, with almost no exploratory branching.
- Players who seem to stumble upon diamonds and other rare ores constantly, without doing any methodical strip mining.
- Tunnels that make sharp, unnatural turns right where an ore deposit begins.
- An unusually high ratio of ores to regular stone after a mining trip.

As noted by the OPBlocks community: "X-ray is one of the harder hacks to detect because it doesn't have visual cues; watching mining patterns is best."

## Putting It All Together: A Quick-Start Strategy

For the most complete coverage, you'll want to combine PaperMC's anti-xray feature, the XrayDetector plugin, and your own manual observations. Get a feel for what normal mining looks like on your server. This layered approach tackles the problem from all angles: prevention, detection, and verification.

**Your Setup Checklist:**
1.  **Configure PaperMC's Anti-Xray** (set to engine-mode 2) for instant prevention.
2.  **Install XrayDetector** to get automated monitoring and alerts.
3.  **Set up CoreProtect** so you can gather evidence and handle any player appeals.
4.  **Observe normal player behavior** to establish a baseline for what legitimate digging looks like.

## Next Steps to Keep Your Server Secure

Catching xrayers quickly is a mix of having the right tech and being an observant admin. Start with PaperMC's built-in features for an immediate defensive boost, then layer on monitoring plugins for more thorough coverage.
