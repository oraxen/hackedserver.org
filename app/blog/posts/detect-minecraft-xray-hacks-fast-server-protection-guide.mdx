Are you running a Minecraft server and worried about people using x-ray hacks to find valuable resources unfairly? These exploits can wreck your server's economy and frustrate the honest members of your community. This guide will give you practical, effective methods to spot Minecraft x-ray hacks and keep gameplay fair, using both proven techniques and automated tools.

## What Are Minecraft X-Ray Hacks and Why Detect Them Quickly?

Minecraft x-ray hacks allow users to see through solid blocks, revealing valuable ores like diamonds, gold, and ancient debris that should be hidden underground. These cheats give them an unfair advantage by:

- Bypassing the normal process of exploration
- Finding rare resources almost instantly
- Disrupting the balance of your server's economy
- Creating unfair competition for other community members

Catching this activity quickly prevents major economic damage and helps maintain community trust before cheaters can do too much harm.

## Automated Detection Methods for Minecraft X-Ray Hacks

### PaperMC Anti-Xray System

PaperMC servers have a built-in anti-xray feature that works in two different modes:

- **Engine Mode 1**: Replaces hidden ores with stone until a player naturally discovers them.
- **Engine Mode 2**: Adds fake ores to underground areas, which can trigger alerts when someone mines directly to the real ores while ignoring the fake ones.

You can configure these anti-xray settings in your `paper-world-defaults.yml` file, where you can specify block lists and obfuscation levels.

### Behavioral Analysis Plugins

Specialized plugins can monitor digging patterns for suspicious behavior:

- **XrayDetector**: Tracks ore-to-stone ratios and overall mining efficiency.
- **SimpleXRayDetector**: Flags individuals who find precious materials at statistically impossible rates.
- **AntiXray**: Combines block obfuscation with behavioral monitoring.

These tools will generate alerts when someone consistently finds ore without any signs of normal exploration.

## Manual Observation Techniques for Quick X-Ray Detection

### Mining Pattern Analysis

Keep an eye out for these suspicious behaviors:

- **Direct pathing**: Making a beeline for ore deposits with no exploratory digging.
- **Efficiency anomalies**: Finding diamonds at a rate that's way above the server average.
- **Tunnel patterns**: Digging suspiciously precise tunnels that link multiple ore veins.
- **Surface behavior**: Digging straight down from the surface to reach rare materials.

### Statistical Monitoring

Track key metrics that can indicate potential x-ray usage:

- Ore discovery rate per hour played
- Ratio of valuable materials to common stone mined
- Time spent underground versus resources collected
- Digging depth patterns and movement efficiency

## Implementing Fast Detection Systems

### Server Configuration Steps

1.  **Enable logging**: Activate detailed block break and placement logs.
2.  **Set thresholds**: Configure alert triggers for unusual digging statistics.
3.  **Monitor hotspots**: Keep an eye on areas with a high concentration of valuable ore.
4.  **Regular audits**: Review player statistics weekly to identify suspicious patterns.

### Response Protocols

When a system flags potential x-ray use:

- Investigate flagged individuals by observing them in spectator mode.
- Review their digging logs from the last 24-48 hours.
- Compare the suspicious person's stats with the server average.
- Document evidence before taking enforcement action.

## Next Steps for Comprehensive Server Protection

Effectively catching x-ray cheaters requires a combination of automated tools and manual oversight. A great starting point is to implement PaperMC's built-in anti-xray system. From there, you can add behavioral analysis plugins to cover all your bases.
