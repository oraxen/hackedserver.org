Cheating clients are a persistent threat on Minecraft's Bedrock Edition, disrupting gameplay and ruining fair competition. Unlike the Java Edition with its huge plugin ecosystem, Bedrock has fewer anti-cheat options, making your choice of protection critical. This breakdown compares the top anti-cheat solutions for Bedrock, looking at how they detect cheats, their configuration options, and how they perform in the real world to help you pick the best defense for your community.

## Matrix AntiCheat: A Comprehensive Platform

Matrix is one of the most versatile solutions for blocking cheaters, supporting BDS servers, Realms, and even local worlds. Its broad compatibility makes it accessible for just about any setup.

Its key strengths are this multi-environment support and its well-established cheat detection methods. When configured correctly, Matrix boasts a false positive rate of less than 5%, meaning it's reliable and won't kick legitimate players by mistake. The tool targets common exploits while having a minimal impact on normal gameplay.

To get the most out of it, you'll need to enable experimental features and cheats in your world. This gives Matrix the permissions it needs to monitor player behavior and take action.

## SafeGuard AntiCheat: A Customizable Framework

SafeGuard focuses on customizable protection, giving you features like an inventory lock and the ability to summon NPCs to deal with hackers. This approach lets server admins tailor their defenses to match specific threats and their player base.

The inventory lock, for instance, stops cheaters from messing with items they shouldn't, while summoning NPCs can be an active way to stop them in their tracks. These tools provide an immediate response instead of just passively detecting cheats.

SafeGuard's main strength is how adaptable it is to different server environments and rules. Admins can tweak the intensity of the protection based on their server's population, gameplay style, and how many false positives they're willing to accept.

## Obsidian Anti Cheat: Focused Auto-Clicker Detection

Obsidian takes a more targeted approach, focusing specifically on detecting auto-clickers by monitoring a player's clicks per second. If it spots suspicious activity, the system issues a warning, offering a measured response to potential cheating.

This focused method is great for catching the automation tools common in many cheating clients. As 9Minecraft puts it, "Obsidian Anti Cheat is simple and effective for stopping cheating in Bedrock," which speaks to its straightforward setup and reliable results.

Its simplicity makes it a good fit for servers that need targeted protection without a lot of complex configuration. Keep in mind, though, that its narrow focus means it might miss other types of cheats.

## AntiSpoof: Verifying Client Authenticity

The AntiSpoof plugin tackles client spoofing by analyzing a client's brand, channel patterns, and authentication to spot fakes. As its Modrinth plugin page notes, "AntiSpoof uses multiple layers of detection to catch different types of spoofing."

The system uses regex filters for brand and channel names to block or whitelist specific clients. This gives you precise control over which modified clients are allowed, while blocking known malicious ones.

AntiSpoof's verification helps keep your server secure by making sure anyone who connects is using a legitimate client. This multi-layered approach makes it much harder for even sophisticated spoofing attempts to get through.

## Selection Criteria and Recommendations

*   **Matrix** is your best bet for all-around protection across different server types, especially if you need broad compatibility. Its low false positive rate and wide range of detection make it a solid choice for established communities with diverse players.

*   Go with **SafeGuard** if you value customization and active responses. Features like the inventory lock and NPC summoning give you tools to deal with active cheating incidents on the spot.

*   Consider **Obsidian** if your main worry is auto-clickers. Its focused approach is reliable for that specific threat and doesn't add a lot of complexity.

*   Use **AntiSpoof** when client authentication is your top priority. It's particularly useful for servers that deal with sophisticated spoofing or need to enforce strict client standards.

## Implementing Your Anti-Cheat Strategy

Protecting your server from cheaters means picking the right tool for your specific needs. Each solution we've covered has its own strengths: Matrix offers comprehensive coverage, SafeGuard gives you customization, Obsidian hones in on automation, and AntiSpoof verifies who is connecting.
