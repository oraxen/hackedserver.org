Picking the right anti-cheat for your Minecraft server means weighing detection accuracy against its effect on performance and your budget. As hacking clients get more sophisticated, server admins need a solution that keeps gameplay fair without causing lag or flagging innocent players. This guide breaks down five leading anti-cheat plugins, comparing them on key features to help you find the best fit for your server's unique setup.

## Free vs. Premium Anti-Cheat Solutions

### Grim Anticheat: Open-Source Foundation

Grim Anticheat is a standout option because it's completely free and open-source, supporting Minecraft versions 1.8 through 1.21. According to the GrimAnticheat Team, "GrimAC is considered feature-complete for the 2.0 (open-source) branch," which means admins get thorough protection without paying for a license. It also offers full exemptions for Geyser (Bedrock) players, making it a great choice for cross-platform servers.

While a premium version with more checks is in the works, the current open-source branch provides strong detection for most servers.

### Spartan: Proven Premium Option

Spartan is a well-established premium option, priced at $25 USD and supporting versions 1.7–1.20. With over 9,400 downloads and a 5-star rating on Spigot, it’s clearly a community favorite. That price point makes professional-grade protection accessible for most server budgets.

## Performance and Customization Comparison

### Vulcan: Reliability with Limitations

Reviewers often say "Vulcan is generally considered to be one of the best anti-cheats for Minecraft servers out there," especially praising its customization options and reliability. However, testing does reveal some weaknesses. Vulcan can struggle with harder-to-detect cheats like Vape and 3.01-block reach hacks, which experienced cheaters might exploit.

### Dynamic AC+: Lightweight Specialization

Dynamic AC+ is aimed at small to mid-sized servers, offering a lightweight design with customizable detection. The plugin logs evidence and can be integrated with Dynamic PERFORMANCE+ for better optimization. For the best results, admins should use Dynamic CORE+ as their main anti-cheat, with the Dynamic PERFORMANCE+ add-on handling optimization.

### Polar Anticheat: SaaS Approach

Polar Anticheat takes a different path, operating as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). It focuses purely on cheat prevention, not overall server management. This specialized approach can appeal to admins who want a dedicated anti-cheat service that doesn't use up their own server's resources.

## Selection Framework by Server Type

**Small to Mid-Sized Servers**: Grim Anticheat or Dynamic AC+ both offer lightweight, modular protection. They focus on smooth gameplay and fairness without hurting your budget.

**Established Communities**: Spartan's proven track record and 5-star rating make it a solid choice for servers with established player bases that need reliable, tested protection.

**Cross-Platform Servers**: Grim Anticheat's full exemptions for Geyser are essential for mixed-client environments, as they eliminate false positives for Bedrock players.

**Performance-Critical Environments**: For servers where every bit of processing power counts, combining Dynamic AC+ with Dynamic PERFORMANCE+ offers the most resource-efficient protection available.

## Making Your Decision

The best anti-cheat for you really depends on your server's size, budget, and technical needs. Grim Anticheat provides excellent free protection that works for most servers, while Spartan offers proven, premium reliability. Dynamic AC+ is a great pick for lightweight setups, and Vulcan gives you powerful customization, even with a few detection gaps.
