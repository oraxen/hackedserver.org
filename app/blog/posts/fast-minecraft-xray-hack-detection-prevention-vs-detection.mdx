X-ray hacks give players an unfair advantage by letting them see valuable ores through solid blocks, which can wreck a server's economy and destroy player trust. Server administrators need reliable ways to stop this, but choosing between preventing the hacks outright or detecting the cheaters after the fact involves some trade-offs. This guide breaks down the most effective methods for stopping x-raying, helping you implement fast, reliable protection for your Minecraft server.

## Prevention-First: PaperMC's Built-In System

PaperMC has a built-in feature that combats x-raying by manipulating what players see before they even mine a block. The system offers two distinct engine modes, each with different performance and effectiveness characteristics.

### Engine Mode 1: Lightweight Prevention

Engine-mode 1 replaces hidden ore blocks with stone or dimension-specific blocks, offering basic protection with minimal CPU impact. This mode is great for servers with limited resources but has notable limitations—it cannot hide ores exposed to air or transparent blocks in caves, leaving some vulnerabilities for sophisticated x-ray clients.

### Engine Mode 2: Comprehensive Obfuscation

Engine-mode 2 addresses the limitations of mode 1 by replacing both hidden and replacement blocks with randomly generated fake ores. This approach effectively obscures ores even when exposed to air, providing more thorough protection against advanced x-ray techniques. The trade-off is higher CPU usage, making it better suited for servers with adequate processing power.

## Detection-First: Behavioral Analysis Plugins

While prevention stops x-ray cheats from working, detection plugins identify players who attempt to use them by analyzing their mining patterns and behaviors.

### SimpleXRayDetector: Pattern Recognition

SimpleXRayDetector monitors for suspicious activity by tracking mining patterns, particularly focusing on diamond ore discovery rates. The plugin works on Spigot and Paper servers, flagging players whose mining behavior suggests they are cheating. When combined with CoreProtect, administrators can investigate flagged players and review their mining history for evidence.

This detection approach allows cheaters to reveal themselves through their behavior, providing concrete evidence for disciplinary actions while maintaining detailed logs of suspicious activity.

## Compatibility and Implementation

Support for these countermeasures varies significantly across server types. Paper and Purpur servers offer this functionality natively, while Forge, Fabric, NeoForge, and Vanilla servers require alternative solutions. For older Minecraft versions (1.9 to 1.17), Orebfuscator serves as an alternative plugin for obscuring ores when Paper's built-in system isn't available.

To enable PaperMC's ore-hiding feature, administrators set `anti-xray.enabled` to `true` in the `paper-world-defaults.yml` configuration file and select either engine-mode 1 or 2 based on their performance requirements.

## Hybrid Approach: Maximum Protection

The most effective strategy combines both prevention and detection methods. Running PaperMC's engine-mode 2 alongside behavioral detection plugins like SimpleXRayDetector creates a comprehensive defense system. This approach prevents most x-ray attempts while identifying persistent cheaters who try to circumvent the prevention measures.

## Choose Your Strategy

For immediate protection with minimal setup, implement engine-mode 2 on your Paper server. Servers requiring detailed evidence of cheating should add SimpleXRayDetector for comprehensive monitoring. Resource-constrained servers can start with engine-mode 1 and upgrade as needed.

The choice between prevention and detection depends on your server's priorities: prevention maintains fair gameplay invisibly, while detection provides evidence for enforcement actions.
