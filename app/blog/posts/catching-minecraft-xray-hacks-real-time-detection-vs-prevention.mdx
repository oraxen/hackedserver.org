X-ray hacks are still one of the most frustrating cheats in Minecraft, letting players see through solid blocks to find valuable ores in an instant. While preventative measures like ore obfuscation help, catching cheaters in the act requires specialized monitoring. This guide will compare the fastest methods out there, looking at their speed, accuracy, and setup needs to help you pick the right solution for your server.

## Real-Time Monitoring vs. Proactive Prevention

The quickest way to deal with X-ray hacks is to use a mix of two different strategies: watching player behavior in real time and using obfuscation to prevent the cheats from working in the first place. Knowing how each one works will help you find the right balance for your server.

**Behavioral analysis tools** like XrayDetector watch how players mine in real-time, keeping track of how fast they find ore and how efficient their digging is. These plugins are always analyzing player activity and send out instant alerts when suspicious patterns pop up. The XrayDetector plugin, for example, focuses on the speed and frequency of ore collection, using a four-level severity system to notify staff the moment a player starts mining in a way that doesn't seem natural.

**Proactive obfuscation**, on the other hand, works differently. The built-in Anti-Xray feature available in PaperMC hides ores from cheat clients before they can even be spotted. This system changes how blocks are sent to players, making X-ray tools far less effective. The downside is that it doesn't actually identify anyone who is cheating.

## Speed and Accuracy: A Head-to-Head Comparison

**XrayDetector Plugin Performance**
- **Speed**: Sends alerts instantly while a player is mining.
- **How it Works**: Watches for unusual patterns in how often and how efficiently players find ore.
- **Alerts**: Uses a four-level warning system with customizable settings.
- **For Staff**: Provides live notifications with alert colors you can change.

**Manual Observation Techniques**
- **Speed**: Relies on how often staff are available to watch players.
- **How it Works**: Staff look for suspicious activity, like players digging straight to ore veins.
- **Accuracy**: Can be very high if experienced staff spot players mining with unnatural efficiency.
- **Effort**: Requires a lot of staff time.

**PaperMC's Anti-Xray (As a Prevention Tool)**
- **Speed**: None. This is a prevention tool, not a detection one.
- **How it Works**: Doesn't detect anything. It just hides ores to make X-ray useless.
- **Setup**: It's built into PaperMC and configured in the `paper-world-defaults.yml` file.
- **Performance**: Has a minimal impact on performance when using engine-mode 3.

## Setup Speed and Configuration

**Quick Setup Options**

For the quickest setup, XrayDetector can be installed instantly like any other standard plugin. It requires very little configuration to start working, and its default settings are good enough for most servers. You can fine-tune its sensitivity and change the alert colors later on without needing to restart the server.

The Anti-Xray feature in PaperMC is the fastest way to get preventative measures running if your server already uses Paper. Engine-mode 2 gives you the best protection by replacing hidden blocks with fakes, which hides real ores even if they're exposed to air. Keep in mind that any changes to the Anti-Xray configuration require a full server restart to take effect; using `/reload` won't work for worlds that are already loaded.

**Combined Approach Benefits**

The best strategy is to use both systems together: PaperMC's built-in Anti-Xray (using engine-mode 2) for prevention, and XrayDetector to actively watch for cheaters. This two-pronged approach stops most X-ray attempts from the start, while still giving you the ability to catch clever cheaters who might find a way around the obfuscation.

## Performance and Resource Considerations

**Network and CPU Impact**
- **XrayDetector**: Has a minimal performance impact, as it only watches mining-related events.
- **Anti-Xray (Engine-Mode 2)**: Creates a moderate amount of network traffic because it has to send data for fake ores.
- **Anti-Xray (Engine-Mode 3)**: Uses less network bandwidth thanks to better chunk compression.
- **Manual Checks**: No technical performance hit, but it takes up a lot of your staff's time.

**Scalability Factors**
Plugins that monitor players in real time scale well as your server grows because they only need to watch players who are actively mining, not everything everyone does. In contrast, the performance of Anti-Xray's obfuscation is tied to world generation and chunk loading. For larger servers, engine-mode 3 offers the best mix of protection and performance.

## Choosing Your Strategy

If your server's priority is reacting instantly to cheaters, XrayDetector is your best bet. It offers the quickest way to get alerts and has sensitivity settings you can adjust. The plugin's four-level warning system lets your staff react appropriately, whether it's a minor anomaly or a clear case of cheating.

For servers that want to focus on prevention, implementing the Anti-Xray feature in PaperMC (set to engine-mode 2) is the way to go. It effectively shuts down most X-ray hacks by making it impossible to reliably find ore. This system sends fake ore data to confuse cheat clients, all without affecting normal gameplay for legitimate players.

For the most complete protection, combine both methods. Use Anti-Xray as your baseline defense and add XrayDetector on top to catch the more advanced cheaters. This gives you both a strong preventative shield and the ability to respond quickly when someone gets through.
