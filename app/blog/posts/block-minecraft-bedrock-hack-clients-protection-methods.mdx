If you run a Minecraft Bedrock server, you know the frustration of dealing with players using modified game clients. These cheats can give them unfair advantages, from flying and super speed to auto-clickers and kill-aura, ruining the game for everyone else. This guide will walk you through the best ways to block Minecraft Bedrock hack clients, using a combination of proven anti-cheat plugins and smart server settings to protect your community.

## What Are Minecraft Bedrock Hack Clients?

Minecraft Bedrock hack clients are altered versions of the game that give players an edge through automated cheats and exploits. As one server administrator put it, "One flying player or someone with kill-aura ruins the experience for all fair players, and word spreads fast when a server has a hacking problem."

These modified clients can affect gameplay in several ways:
- **Movement-based cheats**: Super speed, flying, and teleportation
- **Unfair combat abilities**: Kill-aura, auto-clicking, and extended reach
- **World manipulation**: X-ray vision and instant mining
- **Client spoofing**: Disguising a modified client to look like a legitimate connection

## Anti-Cheat Systems for Bedrock Servers

Modern anti-cheat plugins are your first line of defense, monitoring player behavior in real time. These systems "monitor player movements, combat patterns, block interactions, and dozens of other variables to catch everything from subtle speed hacks to blatant fly cheats."

### Matrix AntiCheat
Matrix AntiCheat offers robust protection designed specifically for the Bedrock environment. It's compatible with Bedrock realms, BDS servers, and local worlds, featuring advanced detection that can counter cheats designed to disable anti-cheat mechanisms.

### SafeGuard AntiCheat
SafeGuard comes with customizable protection features, like inventory locks that prevent cheaters from using restricted items. It can also summon NPCs to deal with players when a violation is detected.

### Specialized Detection Tools
You can also use specialized tools for specific problems:
- **Obsidian Anti Cheat**: Focuses entirely on detecting auto-clickers by tracking clicks per second and flagging suspicious activity.
- **AntiSpoof**: Uses a multi-layered approach, analyzing things like client brand and authentication patterns to spot and block fake clients while allowing legitimate ones through.

## Server Configuration Methods

Beyond plugins, simple server-level configurations can add another layer of security:

### Movement Speed Checks
Set up server-side speed checks to automatically kick anyone moving faster than the game allows. This is a simple but effective way to stop basic flying and speed cheats in their tracks.

### Whitelist Protection
Use a whitelist. By only allowing approved players to join, you drastically reduce the chance of encountering cheaters. This approach is perfect for smaller servers built around a trusted community.

### Multi-Layered Security
Don't rely on just one tool. The best defense is a layered one. Combine a general anti-cheat with specialized plugins that target specific issues, like auto-clickers, to cover all your bases.

## Active Moderation Strategies

Automated tools are powerful, but they work best with a human touch. Having an active staff team is crucial. Your moderators can monitor for rule-breakers, enforce bans, and spot complex cheats that an automated system might miss. They're also essential for responding quickly to player reports.

## Implementing Your Protection Strategy

The best way to protect your server is to think in layers. Instead of relying on a single solution, combine detection plugins, client verification, and active moderation. Get started with these steps:

1. **Install a primary anti-cheat system** like Matrix or SafeGuard that fits your server's needs.
2. **Configure your server's limits** for movement and block interaction to catch obvious exploits.
3. **Add specialized tools** for common problems like auto-clickers and spoofed clients.
4. **Train your moderation staff** to recognize and handle sophisticated cheats that slip past automated systems.
