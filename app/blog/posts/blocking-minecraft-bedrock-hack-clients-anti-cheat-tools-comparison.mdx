Servers running Minecraft's Bedrock Edition are under constant threat from sophisticated cheats that exploit game mechanics, enable X-ray vision, and manipulate player interactions. Unlike its Java counterpart, Bedrock's cross-platform nature and mobile accessibility create unique vulnerabilities that standard server protections can't always catch. This analysis compares the leading anti-cheat tools for Bedrock, evaluating their methods for spotting cheaters, their compatibility, and their overall effectiveness against modern hacking techniques.

## Understanding the Bedrock Hacking Landscape

Cheating in Bedrock has evolved beyond simple speed hacks and fly modes. Today's threats include "ghost" clients like Kodiak that use CPS randomization and reach adjustments to evade security measures. X-ray texture packs are another common problem, letting players see through blocks to locate valuable ores and gain an unfair advantage in survival games.

Perhaps most concerning are the chat-based command systems found in clients like Weepcraft and Xenon. These commands don't appear in public chat, making them nearly impossible to spot with traditional screen-sharing methods. This hidden functionality allows cheaters to operate undetected, all while appearing to play legitimately.

## Matrix AntiCheat: Comprehensive Detection Platform

Matrix is a versatile anti-cheat addon for Bedrock that supports realms, Bedrock Dedicated Servers (BDS), and local worlds. The system is capable of identifying multiple types of cheats, making it a solid choice for various server configurations.

**Strengths:**
- Broad compatibility across Bedrock platforms
- Can identify cheats from multiple clients
- Supports both dedicated servers and realm environments

**Considerations:**
- Requires enabling experimental game options for full functionality
- Performance impact can vary depending on server size

## SafeGuard AntiCheat: Advanced Exploit Prevention

SafeGuard takes a more proactive approach to preventing exploits, offering specialized features like inventory locking and NPC summoning. These tools specifically target attempts by cheaters to exploit the anti-cheat system itself, creating a more robust layer of defense.

**Key Features:**
- Protects inventories from manipulation exploits
- Uses NPC-based verification systems
- Provides multi-layered defense against exploits

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Must activate all experimental game options
- Cheats must be enabled on the server or realm for deployment

## AntiSpoof: Hybrid Server Protection

For servers running a hybrid Java-Bedrock setup with Geyser or Floodgate, AntiSpoof offers specialized defense against client spoofing. The plugin uses a multi-layered approach to verification, including checking the client brand, analyzing channel patterns, and running Bedrock authentication checks.

**Technical Approach:**
- Uses regex pattern matching for client verification
- Includes a whitelist system for legitimate clients
- Integrates with Bedrock's authentication

**Critical Capability:**
AntiSpoof can tell the difference between legitimate Geyser/Floodgate players and Java players trying to spoof a Bedrock client. This prevents false positives that might otherwise disrupt cross-platform gameplay.

## Implementing Layered Defense Strategies

To effectively protect your server from Bedrock cheats, you should treat anti-cheat tools as part of a layered defense system, not just a single point of failure. Using multiple verification methods catches more evasion techniques than brand analysis alone, which is especially important against sophisticated ghost clients.

**Essential Configuration Steps:**
1. Enable all experimental options and cheats when deploying anti-cheat addons.
2. Configure regex pattern matching to whitelist legitimate clients.
3. Implement several verification methods at the same time.
4. Regularly monitor and adjust your configuration settings.

## Choosing Your Anti-Cheat Tool

The choice between these tools depends on your server's specific needs:

- **Matrix** works best for general-purpose Bedrock servers that need to catch a wide range of cheats.
- **SafeGuard** is a great fit for servers that need advanced tools to stop exploits.
- **AntiSpoof** is designed for hybrid Java-Bedrock environments with cross-platform communities.

For the most comprehensive defense against the full spectrum of Bedrock cheats, consider using multiple tools in a layered approach. This strategy helps you address different attack vectors without getting in the way of legitimate players.
